- Just something I made in some free time while being bored
- Some shit is questionable but IF IT WORKS, IT WORKS.

- I was a bit on crack while making this. I am on the watch for any bugs that may happen.


- Jscript and HTML are not my main languages so do not judge if i make inefficient code. It just works alright?


(btw congrats on finding ts, I really doubt a lot of people will even bother tracking this repository down tbh)
